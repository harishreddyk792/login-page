The login page you see here is built using only HTML and CSS, with a focus on simplicity, responsiveness, and a clean UI aesthetic. I wanted to create something that looks professional without relying on frameworks or external libraries — just pure frontend fundamentals.

The background uses a soft linear gradient that transitions from blue to purple, giving it a modern, tech-inspired look. The form itself is centered on the page and wrapped in a white container with subtle shadows and rounded corners to provide a card-like appearance — something you'd see in many SaaS dashboards or authentication screens.

Each input field is styled to feel natural and intuitive, with smooth transitions and a minimal underline style. The login button includes a gradient and hover effect to give it a dynamic feel, and the extra links for "Forgot password?" and "Sign up" are clearly separated to improve usability.

This login form is fully responsive and adjusts well on different screen sizes. It's easy to plug into a backend service or extend with JavaScript for validation, session handling, or OAuth integration.
